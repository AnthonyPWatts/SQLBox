# SQLBox
A tool for quickly turning a directory of SQL files into a running database.

## Overview
SQLBox is a lightweight, extensible tool designed to quickly transform a directory of ordered SQL files into a fully deployed database. It aims to streamline local development and deployment workflows by automating database creation and management from structured SQL scripts.

## Key Features
- **Supports Multiple Databases**: Initially targeting SQL Server and PostgreSQL, with an architecture designed for easy extension to other databases.
- **Local and Cloud Deployment**: Enables running databases locally in Docker containers or deploying to cloud platforms like Azure and AWS.
- **Simple Configuration**: Uses a structured directory of numbered SQL files to define database schema and seed data.
- **Automated Execution**: Ensures SQL files are applied in the correct order for reliable database creation.

## Future Roadmap
- Expand support for additional databases.
- Provide a CLI tool for managing database deployments.
- Enhance cloud deployment options with built-in Terraform support.
- Introduce database versioning and rollback capabilities.

## Getting Started
